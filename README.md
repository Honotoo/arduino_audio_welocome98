# arduino_audio_welocome98
That is a project I have made for kid`s IT school, Purpose is to greet visitors automatically and make tech-like impression. Code is mess (I know), but it works and maybe will be usefull as example for someone


The audio is based on "YX5300 UART TTL" module and uses MD_UISwitch-main, MD_YX5300-main Libraries/ 
distance sensor was  WAVGAT HC-SR04 HCSR04
